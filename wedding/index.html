All Souls' Church is conveniently located in downtown Stony Brook. It is next to <a href=http://www.stonybrookvillage.com/>Stony Brook Village Center</a> (which features
the lovely <font color = green>Robinson's Tea Room</font> famous for its scones) and is within few minutes' walking distance to <a href=http://www.avalonparkandpreserve.org/index.html>Avalon park and preserve</a>. It is very close to the <a href=http://www.stonybrook.edu>Stony Brook University</a>, and <a href = http://stonybrookny.areaguides.net/attractions_results.html>a couple of museums</a>. Within short driving distance, I also like the West Meadow Beach which is next to the Old Field Club, and also the shops at the <a href=http://www.portjeff.com/aboutpj.html>Port Jefferson Village</a>.
