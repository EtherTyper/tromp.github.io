<H2>Go by example</H2>
Let us illustrate the rules of Go by guiding you through a sample game.
Throughout we will <EM>emphasize</EM> words that are standard terminology in Go.
<!--
The game is played near-perfectly; all Black moves are optimal while
White only makes two non-optimal moves. To the go-buffs among you:
see if you can find them...

<TR ALIGN=LEFT VALIGN=TOP>
<TD>Play starts on an empty board, which is
a square grid of horizontal and vertical lines. This is a small one with
6x6 lines forming 36 intersections, or <EM>points</EM>. The standard size is
19x19, while 9x9 is ideally suited to beginners. The object of the game
is to conquer a majority of the points on the board, either by occupying
or enclosing them.</TD>

<TR ALIGN=LEFT VALIGN=TOP>
<TD>The two players, Black and White, alternate in placing a stone
of their color on an empty intersection. Black moves first. Stones cannot
be moved, but can be captured. The unit of capture is a <EM>string</EM>:
a group of stones of one color that are connected along the board lines.
A string is captured when it has no more adjacent empty points, or
<EM>liberties</EM>.
Above we see two single-stone strings with 4 liberties each.
Note that diagonal points are not adjacent.
</TD>

<TD>
Black 3 extends her string while taking a liberty away from the white string.
White 4 is played symmetrically to restore the balance of liberties at 4 each.
Each player has now staked out roughly half of the board.
<!--
After another two moves, we again have two strings with 4
liberties each. This time, each string takes away 2 liberties from the other.
On small boards, playing in the center is best since it maximizes the stones'
influence over the whole board. Already the players are pushing and leaning
against each other, each staking out half of the board. If white had played
move 4 anywhere else, then black would take C4 on her next move,
leaving White little room to manoeuvre.

Black 5 is played <EM>at the head</EM> of White's 2 stones,

proceeds to bend around White's string.
A move like this,
called ``hane'' in Japanese (pronounce as ha-neh), is typical in Go.
Although Black leaves a ``cutting point'', White cannot
take advantage of it by playing 6 at D2, since Black would play at E2
and chase White toward the edge where she could not escape capture.
-->

<TD>
Black 7 allows White 8 to <EM>cut off</EM>
the lonely stone at C2. This stone is said to be <EM>in atari</EM>,
meaning it has only one liberty and is in danger of being captured on the next
move. Running away to C1 would only invite white to play at B1, leaving
Black no way to get out of atari.

Instead Black 9 <EM>counter-atari</EM>'s White,

White could block at B3, but then Black
gets to play another atari at E2 (and could proceed to block off the right
side at E1), so White instead captures C2 by occupying its last liberty.
Now Black E2 won't be atari and since Black still has cutting points at
B5 and D5, he won't have time to play there.

After yet another atari at Black 11, White 12 wisely <EM>connects</EM>.

<TD>
With two <EM>cutting points</EM> at B5 and D5,
Black decides to defend one of them.
<!--
If Black defends at D5 instead, then White could play A3 and
Black would have to defend B5 still. So White
would keep the initiative. The Japanese say that White plays A3
``in sente'' (pronounce sen-teh).
By defending B5 in the first place, Black makes sure that A3 is ``gote''
(pronounce go-teh) for White; it loses the initiative.
-->
White 14 is a solid extension into the biggest open space.
<!--
E3 would have been a good alternative but then Black will just block at E4
forcing White to defend at E2. Playing E2 directly presents more pitfalls
for Black.  For instance, playing 15 at E3 would be a mistake for Black,
as White could play F3 next and Black wouldn't be able to block at F4.
(this is a tricky variation that you may have
trouble visualizing. The key points are D5 and E5.)

After Black 15, White <EM>pushes in</EM> at 16 before blocking at 18.

<!--It seems Black has lost more on the right than he gained

After White 24 captures, Black plays 25 smack into the middle of White's group.
This may not make much sense, until one realizes that a White move at 25 would
create 2 permanent liberties, or <EM>eyes</EM>, at D1 and F1, that Black
could never occupy...
<!--
the even more mysterious looking
25. What is Black doing playing in the middle of White's area?
Actaully, Black is trying to capture the big White string, and that means
Black will have to takes away all of its liberties, including the
internal ones at D1, E1, and F1.
The liberty at E1 is crucial since a White move there would make it impossible
for Black to take either of the other 2 liberties away.
-->

<TD>
The <EM>throw-in</EM> of White 26 similarly prepares to prevent Black from
making 2 eyes.

Black 27 saves A2, but after reducing Black on the top as well,
White similarly succeeds in limiting Black to one eye.
</TD>
<TD>
Black 31 shows that capture of the opponent takes precedence over
self capture; the captured white stone provides the liberty Black
needs to stay on the board.
White would now like to capture back at D6.
This would however recreate the position in the left diagram,
and thus lead to a neverending cycle of capturing back and forth.
This is called a <EM>ko</EM> situation, and is
resolved by the <EM>superko</EM> rule,
that forbids any move recreating an earlier whole-board position.
White 32 is a <EM>ko threat</EM>; after the defense at Black 33...

White is allowed to recapture in the <EM>ko</EM>. Black 35 takes another
internal liberty of White who has ample time to connect her stones
with White 36.

After Black 37, both sides connect. White's atari at 40 gives
an almost symmetrical situation.

Fortunately for Black, she gets to capture first in the remaining ko,
forcing White to capture 2 stones. After the atari at 43,

White can recapture in the ko, and we get a sense of deja-vu.

<TD>
But now when Black recaptures the ko, White is lost, since the capture
at 48 leaves her in atari still...
</TD>
<TD>
Allowing Black to capture the lot. Realizing the futility
of playing stones which Black can easily capture, White passes.
Black spends another move to capture the last White stone, and both
sides pass in succession, signalling the end of the game.

After 2 consecutive passes, the game is scored. Black has 18 points
occupied and 18 points enclosed for a total of 36 points, leaving White
nothing:(
</TD>
<TD>
Had Black ignored the ko-threat to win the upper-right ko at move 33,
the game would end more peacefully.
The players could just agree to remove the <EM>dead stones</EM> at
A6 and E1 before scoring, resulting in a 20-16 win to Black.
